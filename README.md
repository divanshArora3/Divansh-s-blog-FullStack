live at:https://quick-blog-full-stack-wheat.vercel.app

>Divansh's Blog is a fully functional full-stack blogging platform where I post insights on web development,
>DSA, and programming tutorials. Built with the MERN stack, it features user authentication,
> Markdown-based post creation, commenting, and a clean, responsive UI. The backend is designed with RESTful APIs,
>and the frontend is optimized for speed and user experience. It reflects both my technical writing and engineering skills,
>and is a platform to share learning and projects with the dev community.
